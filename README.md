[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/vostok/commons.collections?svg=true&branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vostok/commons-collections/branch/master)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Vostok.Commons.Collections.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vostok.Commons.Collections/)

This utility library contains efficient non-standard collections and extensions to standard ones, such as [ConcurrentBoundedQueue](Vostok.Commons.Collections/ConcurrentBoundedQueue.cs) and [ImmutableArrayDictionary](Vostok.Commons.Collections/ImmutableArrayDictionary.cs).

It is [source library](https://github.com/vostok/devtools/blob/master/library-dev-conventions/src-libs-conventions.md): its classes are used internally in other Vostok libraries, but it also can be used as an ordinary package.
