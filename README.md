This utility library contains efficient non-standard collections and extensions to standard ones, such
as [ConcurrentBoundedQueue](Vostok.Commons.Collections/ConcurrentBoundedQueue.cs)
and [ImmutableArrayDictionary](Vostok.Commons.Collections/ImmutableArrayDictionary.cs).

It is [source library](https://github.com/vostok/devtools/blob/master/library-dev-conventions/src-libs-conventions.md):
its classes are used internally in other Vostok libraries, but it also can be used as an ordinary package.
